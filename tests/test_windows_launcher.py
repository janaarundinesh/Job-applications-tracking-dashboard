"""The Windows app: Jobby.vbs, and the launcher that reuses it.

Double-clicking Jobby.vbs has to do what opening Jobby.app does on macOS: start
the server out of sight, wait until it answers, and open the dashboard in a
window of its own - and the server it started has to stop when that window goes
away, rather than living on behind the desktop.

Neither file can be run from here: VBScript and cmd.exe are Windows. So these
tests read them the way Windows would - byte for byte, in the project folder -
and pin the things that would otherwise only show up the day someone
double-clicks: the CRLF line endings and single-byte text cmd and wscript can
read, the endpoints and flags the scripts have to agree on with each other and
with server.py, and a script that at least parses (no block left open).
